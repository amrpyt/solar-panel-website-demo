# ✅ Navigation Links Fixed!

## Issue Resolved

All internal navigation links have been updated to work correctly with GitHub Pages deployment using the base path `/solar-panel-website-demo`.

## What Was Fixed

### Components Updated (8 files)

1. **Header.astro** - Navigation menu and logo links
2. **Footer.astro** - Footer navigation links
3. **Hero.astro** - CTA buttons
4. **Services.astro** - Service links
5. **CTA.astro** - Call-to-action button
6. **about.astro** - CTA button
7. **services.astro** - Multiple CTA buttons
8. **blog/[slug].astro** - Back to blog link

### Changes Made

All hardcoded paths like `/about`, `/services`, `/contact` were updated to use:
```javascript
const base = import.meta.env.BASE_URL;
href={`${base}about`}
```

This ensures links work both locally and on GitHub Pages.

## Links Fixed

- ✅ Logo → Home
- ✅ Navigation menu (Home, About, Services, Blog, Contact)
- ✅ "Get Quote" buttons
- ✅ "Our Services" buttons
- ✅ Footer links
- ✅ Service detail links
- ✅ Blog navigation
- ✅ All CTA buttons

## Testing

### Local Development
- Base URL: `/`
- All links work as: `/about`, `/services`, etc.

### GitHub Pages
- Base URL: `/solar-panel-website-demo`
- All links work as: `/solar-panel-website-demo/about`, etc.
