3. Click **"Pages"** in the left sidebar

---

### Step 2: Configure Source

Under **"Build and deployment"** section:

1. Find the **"Source"** dropdown
2. Click it and select **"GitHub Actions"**
   - ⚠️ **NOT** "Deploy from a branch"
   - ⚠️ Must be **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click **"Save"** button

### Step 4: Visit Your Site

Once deployed, your site will be live at:

**https://amrpyt.github.io/solar-panel-website-demo/**

## 🎯 What You'll See

After enabling, the site will have:
- ✅ Home page with hero section
- ✅ About page
- ✅ Services page
- ✅ Blog page
- ✅ Contact page
- ✅ Working navigation

## ❓ Why Is This Needed?

### If you still see 404 after enabling:

1. **Check the workflow**: https://github.com/amrpyt/solar-panel-website-demo/actions
   - Make sure the latest workflow succeeded (green checkmark)
   
2. **Wait a bit longer**: Sometimes it takes 2-3 minutes

3. **Hard refresh**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)

4. **Check Pages settings**: Make sure "Source" is set to "GitHub Actions"

## 📝 After It's Live
